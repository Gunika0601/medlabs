<!-- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). -->
<!-- 
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

### Description of Idea

- IDea : A unified platform for medical laboratories and test centres
- Problem : Unorganized healhcare industry especially when it comes to tests

# An initiative to save millions of Indians
In India while every sector is getting organized and centralised, healthcare sector is often given little to no attention. While we have online platforms to book an appointment to our favourite spa or barber on the tap of our fingers, we lack the basic requirement of mandatory healthcare. A report in 2016 showed that in India more than 2 million people die from **treatable** diseases which go undetected than lack of healthcare. This figure has only stacked up over the years and has seen a boom to due the recent Covid Pandemic. It disheartens our hearts to say that if our platform had been in place before the pandemic, countless number of lives could have been saved. But better late than never. Considering the situation, this is precisely where our platforms comes in. It connects users to labs near them.
